# Scientific-Calculator

This repository contains the implementation of a scientific calculator using multiple technologies, including Java (Swing, Applets, OOP) and web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). The project demonstrates the use of both desktop and web-based interfaces for performing a wide range of mathematical calculations.

# Features

1. Basic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. Scientific Functions: Includes trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), logarithmic functions, square root, exponential, factorial, and more.
3. Multiple Interfaces: Implemented both as a desktop application (using Java Swing and Applets) and a web application (using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
4. Object-Oriented Design: Java implementation follows OOP principles for modularity and reusability.
5. Responsive Web Design: The web-based calculator is designed to be responsive and can be accessed on various devices.
   
# Project Structure

Java Version (Swing, Applets, OOP)
  1. Swing-based GUI: The calculator interface is built using Java Swing to provide a graphical desktop application.
  2. Applet-based Version: A version of the calculator implemented as a Java Applet, which can be embedded in web pages.
  3. OOP Principles: The calculator logic is divided into classes representing different functionalities (operations, display, input handling, etc.).
Web Version (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
  1. HTML/CSS: Provides the structure and styling for the calculator interface.
  2. JavaScript: Handles the logic for calculations, input handling, and display updates.
  3. Responsive Design: The web version is designed to work seamlessly across different screen sizes, including mobile devices.

# Technologies Used

Java (Swing, Applets): Used for building the desktop version of the calculator.
HTML5/CSS3: For structuring and styling the web-based calculator.
JavaScript: Implements the functionality and logic for the web version.
OOP (Object-Oriented Programming): Core design principle in the Java implementation.
